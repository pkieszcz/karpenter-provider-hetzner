## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Server type selection now launches the cheapest compatible offering instead of the first type the hcloud API happened to return. Karpenter core already ranks the instance types it sends by price; the provider iterated them in hcloud's own order (ascending server-type id), which puts the pricier CPX family ahead of CX and could buy a type several times the cost of an identically sized alternative. Selection and launch now derive from a single offering, so the location a server is created in — and the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label stamped on the node — always match the offering whose price it was ranked on.
- **Check your NodePools before upgrading.** A NodePool that does not constrain `kubernetes.io/arch` may now get arm64 (CAX) nodes wherever an ARM offering prices below the amd64 ones it permits — the old hcloud-id ordering produced amd64 incidentally, not by policy. Pods with amd64-only images and no arch `nodeSelector` fail on such nodes with `exec format error`. Pin `kubernetes.io/arch: [amd64]` on those NodePools to keep the previous behaviour. The architecture remains the pool's choice, not the provider's: Karpenter core decides which instance types are eligible for the pending pods, and the provider launches the cheapest of the ones core sent.

### Fixed
- Offerings whose hcloud pricing carries neither a usable hourly nor a usable monthly net figure are marked unavailable rather than priced at zero. A zero price sorts as the best deal available, so one malformed pricing entry would have won every selection under cheapest-first. They stay listed in the catalogue: karpenter core treats an offering that disappears as drift and would replace every healthy node of that type in that location.
- Instance-type selection is deterministic when several types tie on price. Karpenter core's `OrderByPrice` sorts with an unstable sort and defines no tiebreak, so tied types were ordered arbitrarily and two NodeClaims from one NodePool could land on different shapes; ties now break on type name.
- `Create` no longer dead-ends on an instance type whose architecture the `HCloudNodeClass` has no image for. The image is resolved after the type is chosen, so a miss returned a hard error without demoting the type or marking it unavailable, and Karpenter core requeued the same candidate indefinitely. Candidate types are now filtered against `status.resolvedImages`, which the nodeclass controller already populates per architecture — a single-arch cluster is explicitly supported there, and cheapest-first made that combination reachable by default. When no architecture has an image, the error now names the missing image and architecture instead of reporting `InsufficientCapacityError`, which sent operators to their Hetzner quotas for a problem in the NodeClass.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- Pods bound to an hcloud CSI volume can now trigger provisioning. The hcloud CSI driver pins `PersistentVolume` `nodeAffinity` on `csi.hetzner.cloud/location`, which Karpenter did not recognize, so volume-topology scheduling rejected every PVC-backed pod with `label "csi.hetzner.cloud/location" does not have known values`. That domain is now aliased to the standard `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` via `NormalizedLabels`, mirroring how `karpenter-provider-aws` aliases `topology.ebs.csi.aws.com/zone`. No NodePool or StorageClass changes are needed (#46).

### Added
- Chart: `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, `tolerations`, `topologySpreadConstraints`, `imagePullSecrets`, `priorityClassName`, `command` and `args` on the controller Deployment. All empty by default, so existing releases render unchanged (#47).
- Chart: optional `podDisruptionBudget` (off by default; `maxUnavailable: 1` when enabled). `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable` are mutually exclusive positive integers, and configurations that would block all voluntary drains (`minAvailable >= replicas`, `maxUnavailable: 0`) are rejected at render time. `replicas` is likewise validated as a non-negative integer (#47).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** `HCloudNodeClass` graduated from `karpenter.hetzner.cloud/v1alpha1` to `karpenter.hetzner.cloud/v1`. There is no conversion webhook — update `apiVersion` in your manifests and re-apply your node classes (#37).

### Added
- k3s agent bootstrap support: `examples/k3s-nodeclass.yaml` and `docs/k3s-bootstrap.md`.
- Artifact Hub repository ID and badge (#32).

### Fixed
- The chart ships the Karpenter core CRDs (`NodePool`, `NodeClaim`), so a clean install no longer leaves the controller crash-looping on its own watches. Both are vendored from the pinned `sigs.k8s.io/karpenter` during `make generate`, so a dependency bump that changes either schema fails the `generate-verify` CI gate instead of shipping a stale CRD (#44).
- The operator image is pinned to the chart's `appVersion` instead of floating on `:latest`, so an installed chart runs the operator it was published with (#45).
- Return `NodeClaimNotFoundError` when deleting an already-gone server, instead of a hard error (#40).

### Changed (dependencies)
- Bumped `sigs.k8s.io/karpenter`, `hetznercloud/hcloud-go`, and GitHub Actions (#34, #35, #36, #39, #41, #42).
- CI reads the Go version from `go.mod` instead of pinning it.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-16

First stable release: a complete CloudProvider implementation with full drift
detection, observability, supply-chain attestations, and adoption docs.

### Added
- Image label selector: `HCloudNodeClass.spec.imageSelector.selector` filters Hetzner images by arbitrary labels, so you can pin the exact image (version plus baked extensions, e.g. a gVisor-Talos snapshot) instead of fuzzy description matching (#23).
- Wrong-arch guard: provisioning is rejected when the resolved image architecture does not match the architecture the NodeClaim requires (#23).
- Placement group creation and assignment: `placementGroupStrategy: spread` now actually creates/assigns a cluster-scoped Hetzner placement group (previously declared but a no-op) (#24).
- Location drift detection: servers whose Hetzner location is no longer in the NodeClass `locations` are flagged as drifted (#24).
- Label drift detection: servers whose labels no longer cover the NodeClass `labels` are flagged as drifted (#26).
- Structured logging across provider operations (server create/delete, image resolution, drift) via the controller-runtime contextual logger (#26).
- `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` on the controller pod for PSS `restricted` compliance (#26).
- Prometheus metrics (`karpenter_hetzner_*`: server create/delete results and duration, hcloud API calls, drift detections, instance-type cache hits/misses) plus a Helm `ServiceMonitor` (#29).
- Warning Events from the nodeclass controller on every NotReady path, so `kubectl describe hcloudnodeclass` explains why a class is not Ready (#29).
- Examples (`talos-nodeclass`, `ubuntu-nodeclass`, `nodepool-multiarch`) and Talos/Ubuntu bootstrap guides (#28).

### Security
- Cosign keyless signing of the release image using GitHub OIDC (no long-lived keys).
- SLSA provenance attestation (`mode=max`) attached in-registry via BuildKit.
- In-registry SBOM attestation (CycloneDX) attached via BuildKit.
- Standalone SPDX SBOM uploaded as a workflow artifact via `anchore/sbom-action`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- `HCloudNodeClass.spec.userDataSecretRef`: reference a Kubernetes Secret for cloud-init user data instead of inlining it in the NodeClass spec (#20).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Changed
- Upgraded to Karpenter v1.13.0 (#18).
- Bumped Helm chart to 0.2.0 (#19).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Initial `CloudProvider` implementation covering all 8 Karpenter interface methods.
- Instance provider: Hetzner Cloud server CRUD (create, get, delete, list).
- Image family provider: Talos and Ubuntu image resolution.
- Instance type provider with pricing data and caching.
- `HCloudNodeClass` CRD with labels and cluster-scope fix.
- Helm chart for `karpenter-provider-hetzner`.
- Multi-arch Docker image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) built via cross-compilation (no emulation).
- GitHub Actions: test, lint, release, and `govulncheck` security workflows.
- CI publishes Helm chart to OCI registry on release.

### Fixed
- Resolve images per-architecture; NodeClass is `Ready` if any arch resolves (#14).
- Grant full Karpenter-core RBAC in Helm chart (#13).
- Treat `unsupported location for server type` as an unavailable offering rather than a hard error (#16).
