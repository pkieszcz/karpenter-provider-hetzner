A [Karpenter](https://karpenter.sh) cloud provider for [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud). It provisions, bin-packs, and autoscales Hetzner Cloud servers as Kubernetes nodes, picking the cost-optimal server type for pending pods from Hetzner's real-time pricing.

## Status

**Stable (v1.0.0).** The full CloudProvider surface is implemented with unit and
controller test coverage, and the provision → join → drift → consolidation
lifecycle is validated end-to-end against a live Talos cluster (happy, drift,
consolidation, fallback, and invalid-nodeclass scenarios). Releases are
multi-arch, cosign-signed, and ship SLSA provenance + an SBOM. Pin a released
version tag in production.

## Features

- **All Hetzner Cloud server types** — CX, CPX, CAX, CCX, including ARM (CAX).
- **Cost-optimal scheduling** — offerings are priced from Hetzner's live per-hour net price, so Karpenter bin-packs onto the cheapest type that fits.
- **Capacity-aware** — when Hetzner reports a type as unavailable in a location, that offering is skipped for a short window so scheduling falls back to an alternative instead of looping on a sold-out combination.
- **Drift detection** — image, network, firewall, and server-type drift trigger node replacement.
- **Talos Linux and Ubuntu images**, resolved per architecture.
- **Placement groups** for spreading nodes across physical hosts.
- **Cost controls** — opt out of the billed public IPv4 (and/or IPv6) per node class for private-network clusters.
- **Multi-cluster safe** — every managed server is tagged with the cluster name and the cluster's `kube-system` UID, so several clusters can share one Hetzner project without touching each other's nodes. Servers created before the UID label existed are matched on name alone, so give each cluster a distinct `clusterName` until the fleet has rolled.

```

A `NodePool` references an `HCloudNodeClass`. When pods are unschedulable, Karpenter asks this provider for instance types, picks the cheapest compatible offering, creates the server, and the node joins the cluster.

### Reclaiming orphaned servers

A server can outlive Karpenter's record of it. If the operator dies between the
hcloud create call and writing the provider ID to the NodeClaim — a lost leader
election, an evicted pod, an API-server timeout — the machine boots and runs with
nothing pointing at it. Karpenter core does not reclaim it: its garbage collector
deletes NodeClaims that have no server, never the reverse.

Two mechanisms cover this:

- **Adoption.** Hetzner rejects duplicate server names, so the next attempt for
  the same NodeClaim collides. Rather than retrying into that collision forever,
  the provider looks the server up and adopts it, provided it belongs to this
  cluster and this NodeClaim and matches the requested type, location and image.
- **Garbage collection.** A sweep every two minutes reclaims servers Karpenter
  has no NodeClaim for, along with the Node objects they left behind. A server
  must be seen unowned on several consecutive sweeps, and one whose node is
  registered and still `Ready` is never touched — a machine carrying workloads is
  core's to drain, not this sweep's to destroy.

  Every path that declines to act resets the count, so the window always measures
  an uninterrupted run of sweeps that found nothing in the way; a machine the
  `Ready` guard protected never sits on a spent window waiting for its first
  NotReady blip. The count is per-process, so a restart or leader handover starts
  it again — and the operator must additionally have been sweeping for a full
  window before it may reclaim anything, so instability delays reclamation rather
  than authorising it on a short history.

**`clusterName` must be unique per cluster within a Hetzner project.** Servers
are labelled with it, and the sweep uses that label to decide what it owns. Two
clusters sharing a name in one project would each see the other's servers as
unclaimed. The operator therefore also stamps the UID of the cluster's
`kube-system` namespace on every server it creates and refuses to touch a server
carrying a different one, logging the collision once and counting it as
`karpenter_hetzner_orphaned_server_gc_total{result="skipped_foreign_cluster"}` on
every sweep.

Two things this does not cover. It protects servers created from this version
onward; servers predating it carry no UID and are still matched on name alone, so
until a fleet has fully rolled, distinct names remain the thing to get right.
And the UID identifies the *control plane*, not the servers: rebuilding a cluster
from scratch mints a new `kube-system` UID, after which the previous
incarnation's servers are refused forever — never reclaimed, still billing. The
`skipped_foreign_cluster` counter is the signal for both. Recovering from a
rebuild means relabelling those servers with the new UID
(`hcloud server add-label <server> karpenter.sh/cluster-uid=<uid>`, where `<uid>`
is `kubectl get ns kube-system -o jsonpath='{.metadata.uid}'`) or deleting them
by hand.

Set `instanceGarbageCollection.mode: disabled` to pause the sweep during
maintenance that removes NodeClaims wholesale (reinstalling the CRDs, restoring
etcd, clearing finalizers by hand), so it does not act on a cluster that only
looks empty. Provisioning and disruption keep working while it is off.

Watch `karpenter_hetzner_orphaned_server_gc_total` and
`karpenter_hetzner_server_adopt_total`, both labelled by `result`. Sustained
`server_adopt_total{result="adopted"}` means creates are losing their results.
Sustained `result="declined"` is worse: a NodeClaim keeps colliding with a server
adoption refuses to take, so the machine bills with nothing able to claim it. On
the sweep, a rising `orphaned_server_gc_total{result="error"}` means a server
cannot be reclaimed and is still billing, and `result="sweep_failed"` means the
sweep itself cannot run — it swallows list failures to protect its cadence, so
this counter is the only place a permanently broken sweep shows up.

### Node zone labels and consolidation

Offerings are keyed on the Hetzner **location** — `topology.kubernetes.io/zone=nbg1`.
Karpenter prices a running node by looking its zone and capacity-type up against
its instance type's offerings, so a node's zone label has to be a location too.

`hcloud-cloud-controller-manager` labels nodes with the legacy **datacenter**
(`nbg1-dc3`) by default. That lookup misses, the node prices at zero, and because
nothing is cheaper than zero every candidate replacement is rejected. Karpenter
reports `Unconsolidatable: "Can't replace with a cheaper node"` on every node,
indefinitely — which reads like a considered decision rather than a broken
lookup.

The tell is two signals together:

```
karpenter_nodepools_cost_total   -> non-zero and correct
every disruption decision        -> savings: $0.00
```

Both at once is conclusive. Cost stays right because it reads the NodeClaim's
labels, not the Node's, so spend looks healthy while rightsizing is dead.

**Fix:** set `HCLOUD_INSTANCES_ZONE_LABEL_ENABLED=false` on the CCM (v1.35.0+).
Karpenter's registration then fills the label from the NodeClaim, giving the
location. Two caveats: it applies only at node initialization, so existing nodes
must be recreated; and it is cluster-wide, so any node Karpenter does *not*
register ends up with no zone label at all — which fails to price for the same
reason.

`karpenter_hetzner_nodes_price_unresolved` counts registered Karpenter-owned
nodes whose price does not resolve, whatever the cause, and the operator logs a
sample with their instance type and zone. Anything above zero means
consolidation is disabled for that many nodes.

Alert on it together with `karpenter_hetzner_price_health_scan_total`. A gauge
reads zero from process start, so "no broken nodes" and "the check has never
run" are the same number; only a rising `result="success"` says the zero is real.
Aggregate with `max()` across replicas, since the check runs on the leader and a
standby reports zero.

The check asks each NodePool for its own instance types rather than the whole
catalogue, because that is what Karpenter prices against: narrowing a
NodeClass's `locations` leaves existing nodes outside it unpriceable, and a
catalogue-wide lookup would resolve them and report healthy.

Hetzner removes datacenters from its API on 2026-10-01, after which the CCM's
zone label has to change anyway, so the datacenter half of this may resolve
itself. The missing-label half will not.

## Installation

You need a Hetzner Cloud API token with read/write access and a Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner (the [hcloud Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-cloud-controller-manager) should set node provider IDs as `hcloud://<id>`).

```bash
kubectl create secret generic hcloud-token \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --from-literal=token=$HCLOUD_TOKEN

helm install karpenter-provider-hetzner \
  oci://ghcr.io/paperclipinc/charts/karpenter-provider-hetzner \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set clusterName=my-cluster \
  --set auth.secretRef.name=hcloud-token
```

`clusterName` is **required** — it scopes which servers this controller manages. The controller fails fast if it is unset.

Three CRDs ship in the chart's `crds/` directory and are installed automatically by Helm: `HCloudNodeClass` (this provider) plus the `NodePool` and `NodeClaim` core CRDs from `karpenter.sh`, which the controller watches. No separate CRD install step is needed.

> **Upgrading:** Helm only ever *installs* resources from `crds/`; it never updates them. When upgrading to a chart whose karpenter core version changed, apply the CRDs yourself before `helm upgrade`:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl apply --server-side -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperclipinc/karpenter-provider-hetzner/main/charts/karpenter-provider-hetzner/crds/
> ```

## Usage

Create an `HCloudNodeClass` describing how nodes are built, and a `NodePool` describing what Karpenter may provision:

```yaml
apiVersion: karpenter.hetzner.cloud/v1
kind: HCloudNodeClass
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  locations: [nbg1, fsn1]          # Hetzner locations to schedule into
  networkID: 123456                # private network the nodes join
  imageSelector:
    family: talos                  # talos | ubuntu
    version: "v1.9"                # optional substring match
  firewallIDs: [987654]            # optional
  sshKeyIDs: [42]                  # optional
  placementGroupStrategy: spread   # spread | none (default spread)
  enablePublicIPv4: false          # default true; false saves the primary-IPv4 charge
  userData: |                      # cloud-init / Talos machine config (or use userDataSecretRef to source from a Secret)
    ...
---
apiVersion: karpenter.sh/v1
kind: NodePool
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      nodeClassRef:
        group: karpenter.hetzner.cloud
        kind: HCloudNodeClass
        name: default
      requirements:
        # Pinned to amd64 so this pool never picks an architecture your images may
        # not have. Add arm64 (and see examples/nodepool-multiarch.yaml) once your
        # images are published as multi-arch manifests.
        - key: kubernetes.io/arch
          operator: In
          values: [amd64]
        - key: karpenter.hetzner.cloud/server-family
          operator: In
          values: [cax, cpx]
  limits:
    cpu: "100"
  disruption:
    consolidationPolicy: WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized
```

### Node labels

Provisioned nodes carry, in addition to the well-known Karpenter labels:

| Label | Example | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` | `nbg1` | Hetzner location |
| `node.kubernetes.io/instance-type` | `cax21` | Hetzner server type |
| `karpenter.hetzner.cloud/server-family` | `cax` | Type family (cx/cpx/cax/ccx) |
| `karpenter.hetzner.cloud/cpu-type` | `shared` | `shared` or `dedicated` |

## HCloudNodeClass reference

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `locations` | `[]string` | yes | — | Hetzner locations (min 1) |
| `networkID` | `int64` | yes | — | Private network ID nodes attach to |
| `imageSelector.family` | `talos`\|`ubuntu` | yes | — | OS image family |
| `imageSelector.version` | `string` | no | newest | Version substring to match against the image description |
| `imageSelector.selector` | `map[string]string` | no | — | hcloud label filter applied when listing images (e.g. `{"caph-image-name": "talos-v1.9.5-gvisor"}`). Prefer this over `version` to pin an exact snapshot (version + baked extensions). All labels must match; the provider guards against provisioning a node whose resolved image arch does not match the server type. |
| `firewallIDs` | `[]int64` | no | — | Firewalls to attach |
| `sshKeyIDs` | `[]int64` | no | — | SSH keys to install |
| `placementGroupStrategy` | `spread`\|`none` | no | `spread` | Placement-group behavior. `spread` distributes nodes across physical hosts; `none` disables placement groups. |
| `enablePublicIPv4` | `*bool` | no | `true` | Attach a public IPv4 (billed separately by Hetzner). Set `false` on private-network clusters to drop the charge. |
| `enablePublicIPv6` | `*bool` | no | `true` | Attach a public IPv6. |
| `labels` | `map[string]string` | no | — | Extra hcloud labels on the Hetzner server (useful for cost attribution or firewall label-selectors) |
| `userData` | `string` | no | — | Inline cloud-init / Talos machine config. Overridden by `userDataSecretRef` when both are set. |
| `userDataSecretRef` | `object {namespace, name, key}` | no | — | Source `userData` from a Secret instead of inline. The Secret is read at server-create time; its value never appears in the NodeClass spec or git. Takes precedence over `userData`. |
| `kubelet.systemReserved` | `map[string]string` | no | — | What your bootstrap passes to the kubelet as `--system-reserved`. Keys: `cpu`, `memory`, `ephemeral-storage`, `pid`. |
| `kubelet.kubeReserved` | `map[string]string` | no | — | What your bootstrap passes as `--kube-reserved`. Same keys. |
| `kubelet.evictionHard` | `map[string]string` | no | `memory.available: 100Mi`, `nodefs.available: 10%` | What your bootstrap passes as `--eviction-hard`. Values are a quantity (`400Mi`) or a percentage (`10%`). |

Status exposes `conditions` (`ImagesReady`, `NetworkReady`, `ResourcesReady`, `UserDataReady`, aggregated into `Ready`) and `resolvedImages` (image ID per architecture).

### Declaring kubelet reservations

Karpenter decides which server type a pod fits on by subtracting reserved
resources from a type's capacity. It cannot see your bootstrap, so anything your
userData reserves has to be declared here as well:

```yaml
spec:
  kubelet:
    systemReserved: {cpu: 200m, memory: 512Mi}
    kubeReserved:   {cpu: 200m, memory: 512Mi}
    evictionHard:   {memory.available: 400Mi}
```

**These values describe your userData; they do not configure it.** Setting them
here does not change what the node reserves, and the two must be kept in
agreement. Declaring less than the bootstrap actually reserves is the failure
worth knowing about: Karpenter then believes a server is larger than it is,
picks one too small for the pod, and the pod stays `Pending` while the empty node
is consolidated away and replaced — indefinitely, without an error anywhere.

Karpenter's own `nodeclaim/consistency` check will not catch this. It compares
capacity rather than allocatable, and only reports a shortfall beyond 10%.

Omitting the block leaves the previous behaviour in place — a flat `100m`/`100Mi`
reserve plus the kubelet's own default eviction thresholds — so upgrading cannot
silently raise a node's advertised capacity. Declaring a block replaces that
default with exactly what you state, so declare everything your bootstrap
reserves, not just the parts that differ.

### Advertised vs. usable memory

Hetzner advertises the memory a VM is allocated, but the guest kernel never sees
all of it — firmware, the kernel image and per-page structures take a cut that
grows with the size of the machine. A server advertised as 32Gi reports about
31.3Gi; one advertised as 4Gi reports about 3.7Gi.

The provider holds back `VM_MEMORY_OVERHEAD_PERCENT` (default `0.075`) to cover
this. It is only an estimate, and it is only used until a node of that server
type and image registers: from then on the capacity that node reported is used
instead, keyed by server type and resolved image. Look for
`recorded server type memory capacity measured from a registered node` in the
logs.

If nodes still register smaller than Karpenter expected, raise the percentage.
Lower it only with measurements in hand.

## Examples

Ready-to-apply examples live in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory.  Each
file is multi-document YAML (NodeClass + NodePool in one file) with inline
comments explaining every field.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [`examples/talos-nodeclass.yaml`](examples/talos-nodeclass.yaml) | Talos Linux, private-network cluster, image pinned via label selector, machineconfig from a Secret |
| [`examples/ubuntu-nodeclass.yaml`](examples/ubuntu-nodeclass.yaml) | Ubuntu 24.04, kubeadm join via inline cloud-init `userData` |
| [`examples/k3s-nodeclass.yaml`](examples/k3s-nodeclass.yaml) | k3s agent join via cloud-init on an Ubuntu image (for k3s-based clusters) |
| [`examples/nodepool-multiarch.yaml`](examples/nodepool-multiarch.yaml) | Multi-arch pattern: one NodeClass, two NodePools (amd64 CCX + arm64 CAX) |

### Bootstrap guides

- [Talos bootstrap guide](docs/talos-bootstrap.md) — obtaining the worker machineconfig, pinning images, and verifying node join.
- [Ubuntu bootstrap recipe](docs/ubuntu-bootstrap.md) — kubeadm join via cloud-init, keeping tokens out of git, trade-offs vs Talos.
- [k3s bootstrap recipe](docs/k3s-bootstrap.md) — k3s agent join via cloud-init, using the hcloud CCM for providerID; the natural path for k3s installers (hetzner-k3s, kube-hetzner).

## Configuration

| Env var | Required | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `HCLOUD_TOKEN` | yes | Hetzner Cloud API token |
| `CLUSTER_NAME` | yes | Cluster identifier; scopes managed servers. Must be unique per Hetzner project — two clusters sharing a value will reclaim each other's servers |
| `INSTANCE_GARBAGE_COLLECTION_MODE` | no (`enabled`) | `enabled`, `observe` or `disabled`; an unrecognised value stops the operator starting (chart value: `instanceGarbageCollection.mode`) |
| `CLUSTER_NAME` | yes | Cluster identifier; scopes managed servers |
| `VM_MEMORY_OVERHEAD_PERCENT` | no (0.075) | Fraction of advertised memory assumed invisible to the guest, used until a node of that type reports its real capacity. Must be `>= 0` and `< 1`. |
| `METRICS_PORT` | no (8080) | Prometheus metrics port |
| `HEALTH_PROBE_PORT` | no (8081) | Health/readiness probe port |

## Cost notes

- Pricing uses the **net** hourly figure, so relative comparisons match your Hetzner invoice (before VAT).
- Hetzner bills the primary IPv4 separately. On private-network clusters, set `enablePublicIPv4: false` to drop it.
- Selection is cheapest-first, so a NodePool that permits several architectures or families gets whichever priced offering is cheapest for the requested shape — which may be ARM (CAX). Constrain `kubernetes.io/arch` or `server-family` to steer Karpenter, and publish multi-arch images before allowing arm64.
