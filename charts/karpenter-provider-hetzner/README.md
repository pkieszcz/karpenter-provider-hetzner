# karpenter-provider-hetzner (Helm chart)

Deploys the Karpenter cloud provider for Hetzner Cloud. See the [project README](../../README.md) for concepts and usage.

## Install

```bash
kubectl create secret generic hcloud-token -n kube-system --from-literal=token=$HCLOUD_TOKEN

helm install karpenter-provider-hetzner ./charts/karpenter-provider-hetzner \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set clusterName=my-cluster \
  --set auth.secretRef.name=hcloud-token
```

`clusterName` is required; the controller fails to start without it.

## Upgrading to 2.0.0 (CRD `v1`)

Chart 2.0.0 graduates the `HCloudNodeClass` CRD from
`karpenter.hetzner.cloud/v1alpha1` to the stable `/v1`. There is **no
conversion webhook**, so this is a breaking change:

```bash
helm upgrade karpenter-provider-hetzner ./charts/karpenter-provider-hetzner -n kube-system
# Helm does not upgrade CRDs in crds/ on its own — apply the new CRD, then
# re-apply your node classes with apiVersion: karpenter.hetzner.cloud/v1:
kubectl apply -f charts/karpenter-provider-hetzner/crds/
kubectl apply -f your-nodeclasses-v1.yaml
```

Existing `v1alpha1` objects are not migrated automatically; recreate them under
`v1` (the spec is unchanged — only the `apiVersion` differs).

## Values

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `clusterName` | `""` (required) | Scopes which servers the controller manages; must be unique per Hetzner project |
| `instanceGarbageCollection.mode` | `enabled` | `enabled`, `observe` (report what would be reclaimed, delete nothing) or `disabled` (see values.yaml) |
| `replicas` | `1` | Controller replicas |
| `image.repository` | `ghcr.io/paperclipinc/karpenter-provider-hetzner` | Image |
| `image.tag` | `""` | Empty tracks the chart appVersion; pin a tag in production |
| `image.pullPolicy` | `IfNotPresent` | Image pull policy |
| `auth.secretRef.name` | `hcloud-token` | Secret holding the Hetzner token |
| `auth.secretRef.key` | `token` | Key within the secret |
| `serviceAccount.create` | `true` | Create the service account |
| `serviceAccount.name` | `karpenter` | Service account name |
| `metrics.port` | `8080` | Prometheus metrics port |
| `healthProbe.port` | `8081` | Health/readiness probe port |
| `resources` | see values.yaml | Container resources |
| `nodeSelector` | `{}` | Pin the controller pod to specific nodes |
| `affinity` | `{}` | `nodeAffinity` / `podAntiAffinity` |
| `tolerations` | `[]` | Tolerate node taints |
| `topologySpreadConstraints` | `[]` | Spread replicas across nodes/zones; needs a labelSelector matching the pod labels |
| `imagePullSecrets` | `[]` | Pull from a private registry mirror |
| `priorityClassName` | `""` | Pod priority class |
| `podDisruptionBudget.enabled` | `false` | Create a PodDisruptionBudget (enable with `replicas > 1`) |
| `podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable` | unset | Positive integer; mutually exclusive with `maxUnavailable` |
| `podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` | `1` (default) | Positive integer; never blocks drains (run `replicas >= 2` for availability) |
| `command` | `[]` | Override the container entrypoint (advanced) |
| `args` | `[]` | Controller flags, e.g. `--log-level`, `--feature-gates` |
| `serviceMonitor.enabled` | `false` | Deploy a Service + ServiceMonitor for Prometheus Operator |
| `serviceMonitor.interval` | `30s` | Scrape interval |
| `serviceMonitor.additionalLabels` | `{}` | Extra labels on the ServiceMonitor (for Prometheus Operator selector) |

The CRD is installed from `crds/` automatically by Helm.

## Scheduling

`nodeSelector`, `affinity`, `tolerations`, `topologySpreadConstraints`,
`imagePullSecrets` and `priorityClassName` pass straight through to the
Deployment pod spec; `command` and `args` pass through to the container (the
hardcoded probes expect `/healthz` and `/readyz`, so a custom command must serve
them). All default to empty. Leader election is enabled by default, so `replicas > 1` won't
double-reconcile — only the leader acts. For drain safety with `replicas > 1`,
enable `podDisruptionBudget`: it defaults to `maxUnavailable: 1`, which never
blocks drains (a single replica can still be evicted, so run `replicas >= 2` to
keep the controller available). Configs that would block all voluntary drains
(`minAvailable >= replicas` or `maxUnavailable: 0`) are rejected by design —
checked at install/upgrade, so runtime scaling is the operator's responsibility.

## Prometheus Operator integration

When `serviceMonitor.enabled=true` the chart creates:

- a `Service` named `karpenter-provider-hetzner-metrics` exposing port `http-metrics`
- a `ServiceMonitor` that selects that Service and scrapes `/metrics` at the configured interval

Requires the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) CRDs to be present. The controller exposes provider metrics under the `karpenter_hetzner_` prefix (server creates/deletes, durations, drift reasons, instance-type cache hits/misses, orphaned-server garbage-collection outcomes, adopted servers, unpriceable nodes, and raw hcloud API call counts).

Worth an alert:

- `karpenter_hetzner_orphaned_server_gc_total{result="error"}` — a server cannot be reclaimed and is still billing.
- `karpenter_hetzner_server_adopt_total{result="declined"}` — a NodeClaim keeps colliding with a server adoption refuses to take.
- `karpenter_hetzner_orphaned_server_gc_total{result="skipped_foreign_cluster"}` — servers carry this cluster's `clusterName` but another cluster's UID. Either two clusters share a name in one Hetzner project, or this cluster's control plane was rebuilt and these servers predate it. Either way they will never be reclaimed.

Note that the metrics endpoint is scraped on every replica, but the sweeps behind these metrics run only on the leader. Aggregate with `max()` rather than `avg()`/`min()`, or a standby's zero will read as a healthy cluster.
